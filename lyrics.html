Time is standing still and I don't wanna leave your lips
Tracing my body with your fingertips
I know what you're feeling and I know you wanna say it (yeah, say it)
I do too, but we gotta be patient (gotta be patient)

'Cause someone like me
And someone like you
Really shouldn't work, yeah, the history is proof
Damned if I don't
Damned if I do
You know, by now, we've seen it all

Said, oh
We should fall in love with our eyes closed
Better if we keep it where we don't know
The beds we've been in
The names and the faces of who we were with
And, oh
Ain't nobody perfect, but it's all good
The past can't hurt us if we don't look
Let's let it go
Better if we fall in love with our eyes closed

Oh, oh, oh

I got tunnel vision every second that you're with me
No, I don't care what anybody says
Just kiss me (oh)

'Cause you look like trouble, but it could be good
I've been the same, kind of misunderstood
Whatever you've done, trust, it ain't nothing new
You know by now we've seen it all

Said, oh
We should fall in love with our eyes closed
Better if we keep it where we don't know
The beds we've been in
The names and the faces of who we were with
And, oh
Ain't nobody perfect, but it's all good
The past can't hurt us if we don't look
Let's let it go
Better if we fall in love with our eyes closed

Oh, oh
Keep your eyes closed

'Cause someone like me
And someone like you
Really shouldn't work, yeah, the history is proof
Damned if I don't
Damned if I do
You know, by now, we've seen it all

Said, oh
We should fall in love with our eyes closed
Better if we keep it where we don't know
The beds we've been in
The names and the faces of who we were with
And, oh
Ain't nobody perfect, but it's all good
The past can't hurt us if we don't look
Let's let it go
Better if we fall in love with our eyes closed

Oh, with our eyes closed
